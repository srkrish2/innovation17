					Problems share patterns which describe the structure and&nbsp;essence of problems abstractly.
					In this task, we would like you to generate a pattern for a problem. We will first demonstrate
					the process of generating a pattern through an example.

				<b>An example problem:</b>
				In cold weather, you often find single dropped gloves lying on the street lonely.
				Almost everyone, not only kids, has lost one of their gloves, leaving the other useless. It is frustrating
				and a waste of money. How can we solve the problem of losing gloves? An abstract description for this problem
				is the following: Some objects need to work together in a pair. The problem is one of the pair is often lost
				leaving their partner useless. How can we prevent losing one of the pair?
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>A similar problem:</b>
				Women like wearing earrings. But they get lost very easily. There's nothing more frustrating than
				looking in the mirror and realizing you've lost an earring or going to grab a pair from your dresser and finding
				only one. How can we solve the problem of losing earrings?
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>By comparing the gloves-dropping problem with the earrings dropping problem, we can generate a pattern for the gloves-dropping
				problem like this:</b>
				Some objects need to work together in a pair. The problem is one of the pair is often lost leaving their partner useless.
				How can we prevent losing one of the pair?
			</p>
			<h3>The pattern describes the structure and essence of the problem without mentioning the specific domain information such as gloves.
				In this task, we would like you to generate a pattern for the following problem:

		 	<Text>Step 3: Now please generate a pattern for the engineer's problem. Tip 1: You can map the objects between the
				engineer's problem and the one you came up with to generate the shared structure. Tip 2: The pattern should describe
				the characteristics of the objects in the problem and the relation structure between objects. If you have difficulty
				of describing objects and structures, you can search them in WordNet for inspirations.
