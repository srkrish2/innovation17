        <h3>
                In this task, you will learn how to generate a pattern for a problem by reading an example.
                After the example we will ask you to generate patterns for two problems, one by one.
        </h3>

            <b>
                Problems share patterns which describe the structure and essence of problems abstractly.
                We will first demonstrate
                the process of generating a pattern through an example.
            </b>

        <p>
            <b>An example problem:</b>
            <i>In cold weather, you often find single dropped gloves lying on the street lonely.
            Almost everyone, not only kids, has lost one of their gloves, leaving the other useless. It is frustrating
            and a waste of money. How can we solve the problem of losing gloves?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A similar problem:</b>
            <i>Women like wearing earrings. But they get lost very easily. There's nothing more frustrating than
            looking in the mirror and realizing you've lost an earring or going to grab a pair from your dresser and finding
            only one. How can we solve the problem of losing earrings?</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>By comparing the gloves-dropping problem with the earrings-dropping problem, we can generate a pattern for the gloves-dropping problem like this:</b>
            <i>Some objects need to work together in a pair. The problem is one of the pair is often lost leaving their partner useless. How can we prevent losing one of the pair?</i>
          <font color="green">This pattern is good because it abstracts "gloves" into "a pair of objects" and captures the relation that "pairs need to work together".</font>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>A bad pattern</b>: <i>Things don't work properly. How do we fix them?</i>
            <font color="red">This pattern is too general and doesn't describe the outline of the problem.</font><br/>
            <b>A bad pattern</b>: <i>How to prevent people from losing gloves in the cold weather. </i>
            <font color="red">This pattern contains too much of the domain information such as "gloves" and "weather".</font>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h3>First problem</h3>
        <p><i><font color="green">{{problem}}</font></i></p>
        <b>We know this task can be challenging. Please follow the steps that can help you generate a good pattern.</b>
        <p> Step 1: Please describe the above problem in your own words: how would you describe it to a friend?</p>
        <textarea rows="7" cols="100" class="summary"></textarea>
        <br/><br/>

        <p>Step 2: Think of a similar problem in a different domain and describe it below.</p>
        <textarea rows="7" cols="100" class="similar"></textarea>
        <br/><br/>

        <p>
            Step 3: Now please generate a pattern for the problem.<br/>
            <i>Tip</i>: You can map the objects between our problem and the one you came up with to generate a shared structure. <br/>
        </p>
        <textarea rows="7" cols="100" class="schema"></textarea>
        <br/><br/>
        <input type="submit" value="Move on to the next problem" class="submit">
        <p><font color="red" size="2">
            Make sure you have followed the instructions
            and generated a good pattern for this problem. You won't be able to come back to this page.
